This repository hosts tileset modifications.

Currently, it includes tilesets created by other people and modified by me. Below are the names & authors of those mods as well as a link to the original(?) upload.

Volcanic Tileset - https://addons.wz2100.net/28
a mod by NoQ & Berg

Paradise Tileset - https://addons.wz2100.net/29
a mod by NoQ & Jorzi & Berg

Glacier Tileset - https://addons.wz2100.net/30
a mod by NoQ & Jorzi & qubodup & aubergine & cnceo


### _If you don't use the tilesets as part of a map but instead as a game mod, please note that 
# **SOME TILESET MODS CANNOT BE USED AT THE SAME TIME!**
### The Paradise and Volcanic tilesets both overwrite the Arizona tileset and thus conflict with each other_
